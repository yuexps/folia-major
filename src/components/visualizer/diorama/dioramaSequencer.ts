// src/components/visualizer/diorama/dioramaSequencer.ts
// The 3D camera-transition state machine for the diorama flythrough.
//
// The diorama used to be strictly per-song: one corridor built at world origin, and a song change /
// single-loop restart snapped the camera back to origin (masked by a flat fade overlay). That masked
// the cut instead of performing it. This sequencer instead keeps every song (and every loop-round) as a
// corridor SEGMENT living at its OWN place in one shared world: the transition controller spawns each new
// segment at a deliberate offset (dioramaTransition.ts) far from the current one, and the camera flies
// the gap. Line indices are GLOBAL across segments, so the mounted window can hold two segments at once -
// the outgoing scene receding into the fog behind while the incoming scene emerges from the fog ahead.
// No overlay, no black, no snapshot layer, the picture never hidden.
//
// This module is pure (no React, no three.js) so the whole state machine is unit-testable. The React
// orchestrator (VisualizerDiorama) owns one SequencerState in a ref, appends on transition edges, and
// hands the segments + a global index to CameraRig / DioramaScene, which resolve frames/lines through it.

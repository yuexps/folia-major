// line's ACTUAL text placement - which is offset/scaled/tilted off the path), and HOW it frames that
// point is decided by the line's assigned cinematic SHOT. Shot offsets and the follow are composed in
// the line's LOCAL path frame, so moves stay correct as the corridor turns. Line-to-line the SmoothDamp
// blends one shot into the next: varied techniques, smooth transitions.
//
// Deliberately NO audio input here: the camera's motion curves stay clean and composed (the music
// expresses itself through the geometry/lighting in DioramaScene instead). `globalIndex` is the sticky
// position in the continuous-tunnel sequencer (resolved by VisualizerDiorama), so the camera holds on
// the last line through an instrumental gap and, on a song change / loop, simply flies forward one step
// across the graft joint into the next segment - the transition is ordinary forward follow, no snap.
